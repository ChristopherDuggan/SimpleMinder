A simple and customizable app that allows users to set text reminders and send them to their phone or email address of choice.

To start, the user chooses a username, password and an email address or phone number. That point of contact is then set as the default recipient for all reminders (they can add more points of contact later, if they like). A verification message is sent to that point of contact, containing a random number that the user must enter into the app for future messages to be sent.

Once a user has created an account, they can add reminders simply by clicking entering a message, the date and time they'd lie to send it, and which point of contact they'd like it sent to. Scheduled reminders will then appear in a queue, where they can be edited or deleted as desired.

The user can also add, edit, or delete points of contact with relative ease. Each time they do so, the change will require a verification message to be made permanent. 

When the selected time comes, an email or text message is fired off to the user's chosen point of contact. It's that simple.
